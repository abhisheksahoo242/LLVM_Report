## C++11/C++14 features used 
* decltype feature of c++11 is defined as a class in clang which inherits from class Type defined in "llvm-project/clang/include/clang/AST/Type.h" header file.
* clang performs checks called mordernize-use-nullptr to convert NULL macro to nullptr.
* constexpr keyword is quite frequently used.
* AutoType (auto keyword) is defined as class which inherits DeducedType class which in turn inherits Type class defined in "llvm-project/clang/include/clang/AST/Type.h" header file.

## Class hierarchy
There are multiple instances of hierarchy.
For example -
The Type class defined in "llvm-project/clang/include/clang/AST/Type.h" header file is a Super class and multiple classes inherit this class. eg. 
* Class ArrayType inherits Type class and Classes ConstArrayType, VariableArrayType, IncompleteArrayType etc inherit class ArrayType.
* Class AutoType inherits Class DeducedType and Class DeducedType inturn inherits Class Type
* Classes MatrixType , FunctionType, VectorType etc all inherit class Type

Class Type inherits Class ExtQualsTypeCommonBase. 
There are multiple instances of such complex inheritance .

## OOP design decisions for LLVM
Oject-Oriented programming is extensively used in LLVM to make the code base highly modularized so that the code is reusable and easy to understand by new programmers. Classes are used extensively, private and protected keywords are used to hide-data, There are multiple instances of complex hierarchy and polymorphism.

## 4. Design Patterns
The LLVM compiler infrastructure consists of a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies which can be used to develop front-end for different programming languages and back-end for different types of computer architecture. The main idea behind the project being, to introduce as much as possible resuable code in compilers and to make this compiled code more optimized. So to achieve this goal the complier is divided into three main phases, namely front-end, llvm_core(optimizer) ,and back-end. Where front-end is dependent on the programming language, and the back-end depends on the machine architechture in which the code is compiled as a result llvm_core is independent of both the programming language and the machine architecture therefore the code for llvm_core can be used in compiling any source code and on any machine making it reuable. 
The front-end is language specific it optimizes the given source code and outputs a "LLVMIR" stands for LLVM intermidiate representative , then the llvm_core analyzes, and tries to optimize it multiple times, tests the code and finally gives assembly code, which is then converted by the back-end to respective machine-architechture assembly code.

The main features of this designs are -

Modularity - The structure is modular, and the code base is divided into multiple directories and sub-directories. For example the header files are defined in                 "llvm-project/llvm/include" directory. For each directory a Directory-dependence graph is clearly defined. 

Object-Oriented - OOP paradigm is extensively used. The code is divided into classes, sub-class etc .The concepts of inheritence and multi-inheritance is                           extensively used. keywords like protected, private are used frequently to hide data.

 ## 5. Usage of iterators and their own data structures

The performance of C++ data structure(defined in STL) usually depend on the platform and these data structures are not optimized. Therefore llvm has its various Specialized data structures which are optimized and platform independent. 
These data structures are defined in "llvm-project/llvm/include/llvm/ADT" directory such as ArrayRef, SmallPtrSet, StringRef, SmallVector, DenseMap, StringMap, SmallSet  etc.
Each of them is defined as a class in their respective .h file

Iterators are defined in "llvm-project/llvm/include/llvm/ADT/iterator.h" . This header file includes defination of various classes of iterators such as pointee_iterator, pointer_iterator , iterator_facade_base etc , and other functions as well.
Other than specialized iterators llvm uses c++ standard iterators defined in "iterator" header file. These iterators are used quite frequently in the implementation of Specialized data structures like ArrayRef, SmallVector etc .
